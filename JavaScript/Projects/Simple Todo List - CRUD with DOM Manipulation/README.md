To-Do App - CRUD

A simple To-Do app that allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks. The app uses JavaScript for dynamic functionality and local storage to persist tasks even after a page reload.

Features:
- Add Tasks: Quickly add tasks to your to-do list.
- Edit Tasks: Edit any task in your list by clicking the "Edit" button.
- Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from your list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- Local Storage: Tasks are saved in local storage, ensuring persistence between page reloads.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: Structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styling and layout for a clean, modern interface.
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity (Add, Edit, Delete tasks) and handles data persistence with local storage.
